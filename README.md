### Large-Scale Realistic Cloud Rendering Based On Game Engine 
This paper combines different techniques to rendering clouds for both large-scale and short-scale. 
- Perlin Noise: Creates 4 layers with different level of detail of noise. After that, Perlin requires mix them all and thatÂ´s how we can obtain a texture for realistic clouds.
- In order to simulate light passing through the clouds, the paper proposes use Raymarching technique. This technique tracks the light into a cube, lengthens the ray, and detects if the current ray casts on the inner cloud.

The results obtained are:
